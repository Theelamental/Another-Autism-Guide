When this hub gets to a large enough size it will be compiled into a manual and sold in print.
I plan to use the funds from the sales to try and improve services for people with autism.

There will be another section in this hub for developing procedures for improving services for people with autism.

If you wish to advertize your company there will be another section dedicated to that.
