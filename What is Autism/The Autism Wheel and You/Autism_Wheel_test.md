# Autism Wheel Test

![Alt text](<Test results-1.png>)

## Scope
In this document we are going to talk about the Autism Wheel test by idrlabs. 

## Content
The test doesn't have a timer and starts with the first question out of 50 on opening the page.  
There is an option to select a language however I haven't verified how good the translations are for the 14 options.  
Each question has 5 options, disagree, kind of disagree, neutral, kind of agree, and agree.  
After selecting your answer you will need to click next after each question.  
At the end of the test you will be presented with an image like my results above and a section called "Explanation of Facets:" where they have a breif overview of each of the points of interest.  
After the "Explanation of Facets:" section there is a section where they list their references. Which are all from 2015 and later.
