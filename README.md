# Welcome
Hello and welcome to Another Autism Guide.

## Scope
The goal of this repository is to help facilitate communication between people with Autism and everyone else.  
This will include discriptions of how to handle certain scenarios that may be difficult for people with Autism.

## Getting started
It is recommended that you start by reading files in the Getting Started folder to get an idea of the expectations of this repository.  

## Current Plans
We are currently working on developing Procedures and other helpful resources.

## Future Plans
It is our hope that by the end of October of 2024 enough procedures will be made and added to the repository to make a book. They will first be compiled into a PDF which will be free to download and read. Then they will be printed at a limited run and the physical copies sold. The price of the book is expected to be equal to the cost of printing plus shipping and a 10% markup. Current plan for the funds is to help subsidize people getting an adult diagnosis of autism.

### Sponsors
Currently we are not accepting sponsorships.
